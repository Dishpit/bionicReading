# Bionic Reading

## About this project

This project was inspired by https://bionic-reading.com/.

All I'm doing is just converting it into a Chrome extension, to make it easier for the general public to use.

After reviewing the documentation and patent for the original, it seems it's broken down into a few very simple rules, which automatically apply a different styling to portions of the text.
Why the fuck they decided to patent that is beyond me.

Anyway, here are the rules:

1-letter words get full styling
Even-letter words get 50% styling
Odd-letter words get 50% styling, rounded up
